Snake Game in Python
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the turtle library. The game is simple but fun, offering a great way to practice coding with basic game development concepts.

Game Description
The Snake Game involves controlling a snake on a 600x600 green screen as it moves to collect food while avoiding the screen borders and itself. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length, and the player's score increases. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the borders or the snake's own body.

Features
Responsive Controls: Use W, A, S, and D to control the snake's direction.
Dynamic Growth: Each time the snake eats food, it grows by one segment.
Score Tracking: Real-time score and high score display.
Collision Detection: Game resets on collision with borders or the snake's body.
Speed Increase: Snake speed increases slightly after each food item is collected, increasing the game difficulty.
Installation
To play this game, make sure you have Python 3 installed along with the turtle module, which comes pre-installed with Python. Clone or download this repository, navigate to the game file, and run it.

bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
Controls
W - Move up
S - Move down
A - Move left
D - Move right
Code Structure
Main Game Loop: Handles the game’s primary functionality, updating the screen and checking for events like collisions and food collection.
Functions:
move(): Moves the snake based on its current direction.
go_up(), go_down(), go_left(), go_right(): Functions to change the snake’s direction.
Collision handling and score updating are managed within the main loop.
Requirements
Python 3
Turtle library (pre-installed with Python)
How to Play
Run the snake_game.py file.
Use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the snake.
Collect the red food to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid colliding with the screen borders or the snake's own body.
Try to beat your high score!
Future Improvements
Potential enhancements could include:

Adding sound effects for food collection and collisions.
Implementing a pause feature.
Creating different levels with varying difficulties.
