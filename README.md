This is a simple implement of the classic game Snake using Python's turtle graphics library. The game has basic gameplay mechanics: there's the player controlling the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

 The project is suited for beginners, which demonstrates how powerful the built-in libraries of Python are for creating interactive games.

Features

Snake movement: Use w,s,a,d to control the snake.
Food Generation: A randomly generated food the snake can "eat" to become longer
Show Score: Displays the score in real-time, which increases every time the snake eats the food
Game Over Condition: Over when the snake bumps into a wall or itself
Responsive Control: Arrow keys should change the direction of the snake.
Requirements
Python 3.0
turtle module, which is pre-installed with Python
Installation:
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-python-turtle.git
cd snake-game-python-turtle
Verify if python is installed:

You should confirm with either python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.
Play the game:
    
Just execute the Python script to play the game:
    
bash
Copy code
python snake_game.py
or
bash
Copy code
python3 snake_game.py
Game Instructions
Control Snake: You will navigate the snake around using the w,s,a,d keys of your keyboard:
W key: Up
S key: Down
A key: Left
D key: Right
Objective: Eats the food (is represented by small circles). The snake is extending itself every time it eats food and your score is increasing.
Game Over: Crash to wall, or to the body. End
Code Structure
snake_game.py Main script holding the logic, setup code and turtle graphics.
It contains functions for controlling the snake, creating the food, collision checks, and game over conditions.
screen settings: This includes the creation of window and background color by using turtle.

snake: The snake is defined as a list of segments - where each segment in the list is a turtle object-that move in a given direction

food: The food is set around the screen randomly by making use of the turtle library. The snake "eats" the food based on the collision with food.

Customization
The game can be customized by alteration of the following parameters in snake_game.py :

Speed: The delay variable may be used to adjust the speed of the snake movement.
Screen Size: Screen sizes may also be adjusted as the default is 600x600
Colors: Snake, Food, Background colors
Example
 End.
Thanks to the awesome community for providing tools and resources for creating simple games in Python!
